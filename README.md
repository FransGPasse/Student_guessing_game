# Student guessing-game

## Objective
The objective of this assignment was to create a quiz-like game using vanilla JavaScript where you would receive random pictures and names from an array of your classmates and then match the correct name with that student. The original array consisting of objects with a name and an image of every student was to remain the same before and after. All the data and status was to exist in the **JS**, meaning we couldn't rely on the DOM. It also had to be responsive. The requirements for a higher grade included using **non-destructive array methods** such as **.map()** and **.filter()**.
